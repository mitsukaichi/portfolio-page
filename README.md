# portfolio-page

## Requirements for the page
- Contains a name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- Click one of the links in the navigation and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- Click on the link to the section about their work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- First application's image should be larger in size than the others
- Click on the images of the applications, taken to that deployed application
- Resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## How I approached this challenge 

1. draft the page design in large screen and smaller screen on paper
2. create rese.css file referring to the [sample found online](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
