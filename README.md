# Create my first portfolio page

## About this project
This project was done as the second assignment of a codind bootcamp as part of the process to learn about the advanced CSS. I created a webpage that meets the following criteria from scratch:

- Contains a name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- Click one of the links in the navigation and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- Click on the link to the section about their work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- First application's image should be larger in size than the others
- Click on the images of the applications, taken to that deployed application
- Resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Instalation

Visit [the published version of this page on GitHub page](https://mitsukaichi.github.io/portfolio-page/)

## How I approached this challenge 

1. draft [the wire frame of the page](https://photos.app.goo.gl/fhcgkmzaRVoqhJzu8) for large screen and smaller screen on paper
2. create reset.css file referring to the [sample found online](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
3. create a skelton HTML with placeholder texts as a framing of the page
4. add CSS to header and headings
5. add actual contents to each section, working on both HTML and CSS to test out the style
6. add media queries to format the style on smaller screens
7. publish the page on github page, make minor tweaks based on how the page turns out
8. complete the README text
